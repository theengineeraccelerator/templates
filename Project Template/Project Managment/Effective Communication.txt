Effective CommunicationThe Engineer AcceleratorMalcolm KnappEmail- Put the main point in the subject line- Do not use relative time. So do not say “see you tomorrow” say “see you Friday” - Do not use reply off topic. Emails like this are impossible to find later. Instead write a new email with a new subject-  If you have two topics to write about split the into two emails- Use bullet points not paragraphs- Do not expect a reply to an email within a day. If you need the information faster give the person a call. - Needing to send a follow up email is perfectly acceptable. People are busy so they may need to be reminded. However, having to send more than three emails in not acceptable. Phone Calls/ Meetings- When coordinating the time for the call give the multiple specific dates and times for the participants to choose from. - Determine who will be running the meeting before hand- Have an agenda/goal- If the discussion gets bogged down in the details take that issue “offline” i.e Have the discussion after the meeting. - At the end repeat back the decisions that have been made- Ask for any last items and wait
