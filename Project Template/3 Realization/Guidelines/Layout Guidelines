Layer Stack Up
	- One Layer
		- Signal. component, power and Ground
	- Two Layer
		- Signal, component, Power
		- GND Plane
	- Four layer
		- Signal and component
		- GND
		- Power
		- Signal
	- Six layer
		- Signal and component
		- GND
		- Signal
		- Signal
		- Power
		- Signal and component

Placement
General
	- Group Components by logical function
		- Power
		- I/O
		- Digital
		- Analog
		- RF
	- Orient components so connections between them are as straight line as possible
	- Orient components so the the number of signal crosses is minimized
Connectors
	- Place on as few sides as possible
	- Coordinate with mechanical design
Bypass capacitors
	- If possible route the power trace through to the bypass capacitor before connecting to the power plane
	- Place as close as possible to power pin

Routing
	- Via to Via
	- Maze Routing
	- X-Y routing
		- Route horizontally in one layer
		- Route vertically in another layer
	- Route traces as short as possible
	- Route Critical Signals first
		- Clocks
		- Differential Signals
		- Bypassing
		- Fast Digital
		- Analog
		- Slow Digital
		- DC
	- Routing differential signals so they have the same overall length to prevent phase differences. Use meanders if needed. 
	- For electrically long traces 
		- use termination 
		- stub branches must be electrically short to prevent reflections. 
		- If vias are needed back drill them to prevent reflections. 
	- Space traces 3 time trace width center to center to minimize crosstalk 
	- 45° Bends on corner to increase routing density

Milled Board
	- Route traces hole components on the opposite side from where they are placed. 
	- Round corners board to reduce wear on the CNC

Drills
	- Minimize number of drill sizes

Silkscreen
	- Only references should be displayed
	- All references should be the same size a readable
	- If possible the reference should be visible when the component has been placed
