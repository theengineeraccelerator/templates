Schematic Guidelines
The Engineer Accelerator
Malcolm Knapp

- Set Up
	- Must have a frame with Project, Designer Name, Rev, and Date
- Architecture
	- Inputs on the left, outputs on the right
	- All text should be readable
	- Group related components. 
- Standard Passives
	- Standard resistor package, wattage, tolerance called out
	- Standard capacitor package, tolerance, voltage called out 
- Passive Labels if non-standard
	- Resistors 
		- Value
		- Tolerance
		- Wattage
	- Capacitors
		- Value
		- Voltage
		- Tolerance
	- Inductors
		- Value
		- Max Current
		- Package
	- Diodes
		- Value
		- Max Current
		- Package
	- LEDs
		- Name
		- Color
- Nets
	- Use standard power and ground symbols for power and ground rails
	- Name all nets. Display these names for all nets except trivial ones. For example the net between a current limit resistor and an LED does not have to be displayed. 
	- No four way connections
	- No nets overlapping with pins
	- All net connections should be called out with a junction
	- Air wires can be used so long as it is clear that the net is connected to another place in the schematic. If you use a air wire indicate this with a named floating net.
