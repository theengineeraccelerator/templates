Schematic Guidelines
The Engineer Accelerator
Malcolm Knapp

- General
	- Must have a frame with Project, Designer Name, Rev, and Date
	- All components should have Name and Value displayed
- Architecture
	- Inputs on the left, outputs on the right
	- All text should be readable
	- Group related components. 
- References
	Resistors - R
	Potentiometers - POT
	Capacitors - C
	Indicators - L
	Transistor - Q
	Connectors - JP or CONN
	ICs - U
	Crystals - X
	LEDs - LED
	Switches - SW
- Standard Passives
	- Standard resistor package, wattage, tolerance called out. 
	  For the project the standard labels are 1206, .25W, 5%
	- Standard capacitor package, tolerance, voltage called out 
	  For the project the standard labels are: 603, 25V, 20%

- Nets
	- Use standard power and ground symbols for power and ground rails
	- Name all nets. Display these names for all nets except trivial ones. For example the net between a current limit resistor and an LED does not have to be displayed. 
	- No four way connections
	- No nets overlapping with pins
	- All net connections should be called out with a junction
	- Air wires can be used so long as it is clear that the net is connected to another place in the schematic. If you use a air wire indicate this with a named floating net. 

- ERC
	Errors - These you must fix
		Close but unconnected wires
		Missing Junction
		Only One Pin unless that pin is a No Connected (NC)		Pin Without Net
	Ignorable - These you can Approve
