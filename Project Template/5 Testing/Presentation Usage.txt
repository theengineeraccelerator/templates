Presentation Guidelines
	- This is an overview of your project. 
	- Audience: Someone who understands the technical subjects but is not familiar with your project
	- Presentations are a support for your spoken words not a replacement for them. 
	- No sentences. If you put in prose then people will read the text as opposed to listen to you.
	- Use bullet points
	- Use graphics if possible
	- 1 minute max per page
  - 10 minute talk. 5 minutes of questions
